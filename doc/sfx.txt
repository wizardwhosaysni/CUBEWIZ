SFX DATA LAYOUT : 

  byte 00      SFX Type : 01 or 02
               SFX Type 1 :
               This type can use any channel. In original Cube implementation, these channels are stolen from Music.
               In Cube/Wiz implementation, these channels now borrow the channels and give them back to Music, like SFX Type 2.
               SFX Type 2 :
               This type only uses 3 channels : YM4, 5 and 6. 
               In original Cube implementation, the channels were already borrowed and given back to Music.

  From byte 01
    SFX Type 1 : pointer table to commands for all 10 channels
    SFX Type 2 : pointer table to commands for only 3 channels (YM4, 5, 6)

  After pointer table, channel data entries are stored sequentially, like music.
  Commands are processed identically to music channel data : refer to music.txt for details.
