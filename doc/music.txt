The music bank starts with a pointer table of $20 entries.
This pointer table is usually at the very beginning of the bank, but some games use the same bank
to store other data like YM instruments, so the pointer table can be somewhere further in the bank.


MUSIC DATA LAYOUT : 

$00 : Always $00. If different from 0, then load entry as SFX instead.
$01 : Set to 1 if YM6 uses FM mode. Otherwise, YM6 uses DAC mode.
$02 : Always $00.
$03 : YM Timer B value. This defines the frequency of sound updates, i.e. music tempo but also SFX play speed.
$04-$17 : Pointer Table of 10 entries, each entry being the command stream to parse for each respective Channel.
$18... : Channel data entries stored sequentially.

There are 4 command sets depending on the channel :
- YM Channels in FM mode
- YM Channel 6 in DAC mode
- PSG Tone Channels 1,2,3
- PSG Noise Channel


YM FM commands : 

  xx (yy)    Play Note xx bits 6-0 (YM range : $00-$53)
             If bit 7 is set, then Set New Note Length yy

  $70        Play Silence for Note Length
  $F0 xx     Play silence for new Note Length xx

  $F8        Loop Command, more details in dedicated section below

  $F9 xy     Note/Frequency Shifting :
             - bit 7 : note shift up (0) or down (1)
             - bits 6-5-4 : add value * 2 to note frequencies, to shift them slightly  
             - nibble y : shift notes by y notes up/down depending on bit 7

  $FA xx     Set stereo panning : bit 7=LEFT, bit 6=RIGHT

  $FB xy     Load Vibrato x, triggered at Note Length 2*y

  $FC xx     Set Key Release or Pitch Slides :
             - xx < 80 : Release key at (note length - xx)
             - xx = 80 : No key release, even between different notes
             - 80<xx<FF : Pitch slide, with xx bits 6-0 = slide speed
             - xx = FF : No pitch slide

  $FD 0x     Set Output Level x and reload instrument

  $FE xx     Set Next Instrument xx

  $FF 00 00  End

  $FF xx 00  Only for YM Channels 1,2,3 : set new operation xx (play music/sfx xx, fade out ...).

  $FF xx xx  Jump to xxxx.


YM Channel 6 DAC commands :

  xx (yy)    Play Sample xx bits 6-0 
             If bit 7 is set, then Set New Sample Play Length yy

  $F0 xx     Play silence for new Note Length xx

  $F8        Loop Command, more details in dedicated section below

  $FA xx     Set stereo panning : bit 7=LEFT, bit 6=RIGHT

  $FC xx     Stop sample play at (Sample Play Length - xx)
             If bit 7 = 1, samples are played until they end or until another sample is played.
             
  $FF 00 00  End

  $FF xx xx  Jump to xxxx.


PSG Tone commands :

  xx (yy)    Play Note xx bits 6-0 (PSG range : $00-$3F)
             If bit 7 is set, then Set New Note Length yy

  $70        Play Silence for Note Length
  $F0 xx     Play silence for new Note Length xx

  $F8        Loop Command, more details in dedicated section below

  $F9 xy     Note/Frequency Shifting :
             - bit 7 : note shift up (0) or down (1)
             - bits 6-5-4 : add value * 2 to note frequencies, to shift them slightly  
             - nibble y : shift notes by y notes up/down depending on bit 7

  $FA xx     Set YM Timer value with xx

  $FB xy     Load Vibrato x, triggered at Note Length 2*y

  $FC xx     Set Key Release at note length - bits 6-0
             If bit 7 is set to 1, then never release key

  $FD 0x     Load PSG Instrument x at total level y

  $FF 00 00  End

  $FF xx xx  Jump to xxxx.


PSG Noise commands :

  xx (yy)    Play Noise with xx bit 2 = feedback, bits 1-0 = frequency
             If bit 7 is set, then Set New Play Length yy

  $70        Play Silence for Play Length
  $F0 xx     Play silence for new Play Length xx

  $F8        Loop Command, more details in dedicated section below

  $FC xx     Set Key Release at Play Length - bits 6-0
             If bit 7 is set to 1, then never release key

  $FD 0x     Load PSG Instrument x at total level y

  $FF 00 00  End

  $FF xx xx  Jump to xxxx.

    
LOOP COMMANDS :

  Infinite loop
    F8 00  Loop Start
    F8 A1    Loop End : Go back to Loop Start.
  
  Volta Brackets (repeat with different ending sections)
    F8 20    Volta Start
    F8 A0    Volta End : Go back to Repeat Start. Used before Section 2/3 Starts.
    F8 40    Volta Section 1 Start : Play section once, and then skip to Section 2 next times.
    F8 60    Volta Section 2 Start : Play section once, and then skip to Section 3 next times.
    F8 80    Volta Section 3 start : No skip for this section, will be played everytime it's reached.
    Typical usage :
      Volta Start
      [...]
