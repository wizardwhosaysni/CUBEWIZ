YM Instruments :
  Accessed in ROM with a byte index : limited to 256 entries.
  29 bytes per instrument :
    4-byte groups representing YM2612 register values for FM operators 1 to 4 :
        $00-$03 : Register $30 - Detune and Multiple
        $04-$07 : Register $40 - Total Level (slot operators get value $7F)
        $08-$0B : Register $50 - Rate Scaling and Attack Rate
        $0C-$0F : Register $60 - First Decay Rate and Amplitude Modulation
        $10-$13 : Register $70 - Secondary Decay Rate
        $14-$17 : Register $80 - Secondary Amplitude and Release Rate
        $18-$1B : Register $90 - SSG-EG
    $1C : Register $B0, Feedback and Algorithm


DAC Samples :

Format is 8-bit PCM.
PCM Sample entries are defined in a table in Z80 RAM.
Data layout of the 8-byte entries :
  word 0-1 : PCM frame period parameter : higher value slows down playback
  word 2-3 : PCM bank
  word 5-4 : Sample length
  word 7-6 : Sample offset


PSG Instruments : 
  PSG Instruments affect the output level with 2 envelope stages : Attack and Release.
  Attack and Release are defined as 2 distinct parts following the same format : "0x" bytes ended by an "8x" byte
  Attack and Release process a single byte per sound update.
  The output level of the channel is the result of (instrument total level - $F + x)
  When the 8x byte is reached, it keeps using that same x value until the note is released or until a new note is played.
